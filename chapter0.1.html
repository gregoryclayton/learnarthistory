                <p>Welcome to the very first chapter of LearnArtHistory.com. Here, we set the stage for your journey through human creativity—from prehistoric cave walls to contemporary digital installations. This chapter explains what art history is, why it matters, and how it can deepen the way you see the world.</p>

                <h2>What Is Art History?</h2>
                <p>Art history is the study of visual and material culture across time and place. It examines not only paintings and sculpture but also architecture, design, photography, textiles, and everyday objects. Art historians investigate how works were made, who made them, what they meant to their original audiences, and why they still matter.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Questions Art Historians Ask</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Who</strong> made this object, and for whom?</li>
                    <li><strong>What</strong> materials and techniques were used?</li>
                    <li><strong>When</strong> and <strong>where</strong> was it created?</li>
                    <li><strong>Why</strong> was it made, and how was it used?</li>
                    <li><strong>How</strong> have meanings changed over time?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Why Art History Matters</h2>
                <p>Studying art history helps you understand cultures, belief systems, politics, and identities. It trains close-looking skills, visual literacy, and critical thinking—abilities that transfer to many professions. It also fosters empathy by revealing how people in different times and places expressed their hopes, fears, and values.</p>
                
                <div class="definition-box">
                    <h4>Definition: Visual Literacy</h4>
                    <p>Visual literacy is the ability to interpret and make meaning from information presented in the form of an image. In art history, it involves recognizing styles, symbols, and contexts to understand how images communicate.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Major Approaches in Art History</h2>
                <p>There are many ways to study art. Some focus on formal qualities (line, color, composition), others on context (patronage, religion, politics), and others on theory (gender, postcolonial studies, material culture). This course will introduce a mix of these methods so you can build a flexible toolkit.</p>
                
                <h3>Formal Analysis</h3>
                <p>Looking closely at the visual elements and design principles of a work—its lines, colors, textures, space, balance, and rhythm—to see how they create meaning and mood.</p>
                
                <h3>Contextual Analysis</h3>
                <p>Placing a work in its historical and cultural setting. Who commissioned it? How was it displayed or used? What events or beliefs shaped its creation?</p>

                <h3>Theoretical Lenses</h3>
                <p>Applying frameworks such as feminism, postcolonialism, or semiotics to reveal power dynamics, representation, and hidden assumptions.</p>

                <h2>How to Use This Course</h2>
                <p>Each chapter builds on the last. Start here to get the big picture, then move into methods (0.2–0.4) before exploring historical periods. Use the sidebars to jump between sections and the navigation buttons to move sequentially.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Skim the chapter headings first to orient yourself.</li>
                    <li>Read actively—take notes, pause on images, and ask the key questions above.</li>
                    <li>Follow the suggested links for deeper dives.</li>
                </ul>
